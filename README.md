# Clubs-Website

Okay now we have pretty cool website that can actually show the blog information

Issues right now
- make showing pictures possible
- make websites look pretty
- create form where people can create blog posts

Okay now we just created the clubs showing

and we have a nav bar now\


Okay where we are at
Authentication: firebase kind of set up, need to work on a tutorial to figure that out
Admin: have the spreadsheet refreshing half working, need to add more functionality
SheetsAPI: need to fix token not being saved and get the spreadsheet id and range to generate dynamically
Connection: connect the blog and clubs pages to each other
Javascript and CSS to have the website look good
